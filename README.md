This is Chable! - an android-based chat application prototype which I built using Flutter and Nearby Connections API plugin.
Unlike most chat applications, Chable! utilizes Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Location Services in mobile phones to create a fully-offline peer-to-peer network.
This app allows users to easily discover, connect to, and exchange data with nearby devices in real-time, regardless of network connectivity.
